<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am currently a <u>Research Assistant</u> in Mohamed bin Zayed University of Artificial Intelligence (MBZUAI), supervised by Assistant Professor [Zhiqiang SHEN](https://zhiqiangshen.com/). Before that, I received my M.Eng. degree from [Southeast University](https://cse.seu.edu.cn/) under the supervision of [Prof. Min-Ling Zhang](http://palm.seu.edu.cn/zhangml). I received my B.Eng. degree from [Chongqing University](http://www.cse.cqu.edu.cn/).

My primary research interest lies in the field of **trustworthy weakly supervised learning**,   <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=_Vx3dZgAAAAJ'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url={{ url | url_encode }}&logo=Google%20Scholar&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations"></a>. Currently, I am particularly interested in areas such as partial label learning, dataset condensation, long-tailed learning, knowledge distillation, uncertainty calibration, and model defense. Here is my  <a href ="../certificates/CV.pdf">CV</a>.

<u>Next year (2025 April), I will begin my Ph.D. studies at the University of Tokyo under the supervision of</u> [Masashi Sugiyama](https://scholar.google.co.jp/citations?user=GkYIrlIAAAAJ&hl=en). If you are interested in discussing with me, welcome and feel free to email me at DongDong.Wu@mbzuai.ac.ae or dongdongwu1230@gmail.com, or reach out via WeChat (ID: kaefer1999).
