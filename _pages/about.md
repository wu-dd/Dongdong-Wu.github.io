Dong-Dong Wu (Âê¥‰∏úÂÜ¨) is currently a third-year master student in [School of computer science and engineering at Southeast University](https://cse.seu.edu.cn/). He is a member of [Pattern Learning and Mining Lab (PALM)](http://palm.seu.edu.cn/) supervised by [Prof. Min-Ling Zhang](http://palm.seu.edu.cn/zhangml/). Dong-Dong Wu received his B.Eng. degree in [School of Big Data & Software Engineering at Chongqing University](http://www.cse.cqu.edu.cn/) in Jun 2021. In the same year, he was admitted to study for an M.Eng. degree in Southeast University without entrance examination.

My primary research interest lies in the field of **trustworthy weakly supervised learning**,   <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=_Vx3dZgAAAAJ'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url={{ url | url_encode }}&logo=Google%20Scholar&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations"></a>. Specially now I am focusing on partial label learning, dataset condensation, long-tailed learning, knowledge distillation, and uncertainty calibration, model defense. Here is my  <a href ="../certificates/CV.pdf">CV</a>.

If you are interested in discussing with me, feel free to drop me an email (dongdongwu@seu.edu.cn, dongdongwu1230@gmail.com) or add my wechat (kaefer1999).

~~**Note: I am seeking a research assosiate (RA) position opportunities** from June 2024 through March 2025. Please feel free to contact me if you have any potential openings.~~

I am going to MBZUAI as RA from Sept. 1th 2024, advised by Zhiqiang Shen, welcome to chat with me if you are interested.
